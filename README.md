# Programming Language Suggester

## Author: Lara Bjork

### Project Description
I completed this project for my second code review at Epicodus.

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

* All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (these included things like using specific HTML tags, custom CSS, and specific Bootstrap styling, along with other requirements).
* Site uses branching to return the result.
* jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)
* Form gathers input from the user.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
* Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
* The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
* Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

_I hope I've accomplished all of this!_

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, JavaScript, and jQuery v3.4.1 (uncompressed development version).
Project was written using Google Chrome; no other browsers were tested for compatibility.

### Project Setup instructions
There shouldn't be any special setup required. If something doesn't display correctly or goes wrong somehow, please contact me at <lara.m.bjork@gmail.com> and I will do my best to troubleshoot for you.

### Known Issues
* Although there is responsive sizing in place, this project is best viewed on standard desktop. It was not tested on a large desktop, table, or phone.
